# UFOs

## Project Overview
Dana a data jouralist who is given the opportunity to wrote about her hometown McMinnville Oregon. She decided to write about a really fun topic - UFO's. McMinnville is famous for it sightings and even has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. It's a topic that Dana has been interested in since she was a child. When she first heard about farmer Trent's sighting back in 1950. For this assignment , the only thing she has to go on so far is a JavaScript file filled to the brim with sighting information. Countries, cities, states, type of sighting, there is a lot in this file. Thankfully, Dana is aware of JavaScript's visual functionality. Its a tried and true language afterall. Her plan is to first use JavaScript to display the data as a table. However, because there is so much data, sifting
through it without any adjustments would be a challenge. JavaScipt provides a way to manipulate the data by adding filters.  Dana wants to put everything together in a tidy HTML page. Her article, the table
of data to support her findings, and easy to use filter to fine tune the results. 

## Resources
- Data Source : data.js
- Software    : Visual studio code 1.67.2

## Results 
We have developed the web page which has a breif description and a table of data which tells us where and when there was a UFO sighting the duration, the shape and few comments about the sighting. This data was huge so search filters were provided so that we can search the data based on city or state or country or the shape of the sighting or based on a particular date.
Below is the image showing the webpage containing the whole data without filters.

To use the search filters we just need to enter the search criteria in one/any/all of the search criteria text boxes provided on the left side of the web page. For example I have included the state as "ar" so the entire result set is now reduced to only 3 rows which has state as "ar".

Again I have included the shape as "disk" so the result set reduced to only a single row which matches both the serach criteria.

## Challenge Summary
Drawback - 
- The web page is lenghty . We have to scroll so much to view the data. 

Recommendations -
- Display of the data in pages such that only few records are visible at a time and we can click on Next to view the remaining pages.
- Providing the search criteria at the top so that all the filters are visible at once.
- Providing a button to search after entering the filters 
- Reducing the description or providing a means to click to view the complete description.
